    Hello!!! This is a website dedicated to photos I took on a school trip a little over a year ago, where I traveled to both Ireland and England (as well as Wales, just not enough pictures). I spent a week in Ireland where we visited Dublin, drove through the Ring of Kerry, and a lot of other places I can't really remember. In England I went to Sratfor-Upon-Avon where Shakespeare was born, and then spent a day in London. I have a LOT of pictures, as I went a  lot of places, but these are some of my favorites! </div>
